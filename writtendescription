There are a few observable trends based on the data in heroes of pymoli.  First of all, the highest percentage of players seems to come from the 15-19, 20-24, and 25-29 year old crowds of people.  Second of all, it might not come as a surprise but there are far more male players than there are female and 'other' players.  Finally, the largest profits came from repeat customers as well as best selling games.
